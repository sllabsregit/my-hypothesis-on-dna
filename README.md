Title: DNA as an Ecosystem-Encoding Substrate: A Hypothesis on the Systemic Nature of Evolution

Author: Robert Stange

Abstract:
This paper proposes a novel perspective on evolution: that DNA is not merely a blueprint for individual organisms, but a generative system capable of encoding entire ecosystems across evolutionary time. It argues that evolutionary changes, while traditionally framed as random mutations filtered by natural selection, may in fact represent the expression of latent, structured possibilities embedded in DNA. This hypothesis is supported by convergent evolution, co-evolutionary dynamics, and the predictability of ecological roles and interactions that recur independently across lineages. The DNA of all living beings is thus proposed to be part of a larger, emergent system that encodes interdependent life forms and the ecosystems they inhabit.

1. Introduction

Classical evolutionary theory views mutations as random events acted upon by natural selection. While this framework is robust, it often underrepresents the structured, repeatable patterns observed in nature: the independent emergence of pregnancy, the evolution of crab-like forms (carcinization), or the recurrent appearance of cat-like predators. Such patterns suggest that evolution explores a constrained and structured space of biological possibility. This paper argues that DNA is not a mere string of codes for organismal traits but a generative system that encodes entire ecosystems in potential.

2. Core Hypothesis

Every possible life form is a product of DNA and, by extension, so is every ecological interaction. DNA, through billions of years of evolutionary feedback, has become an ecosystem-generating substrate. The hypothesis posits:

Mutations are not uniformly random in outcome; they are biased by developmental constraints, genomic architecture, and ecological context.

The genome contains latent ecological functions that emerge under appropriate selective pressures.

Evolution acts not only on individuals but within a network of interacting genomes, shaping co-dependent life forms.

Over time, DNA evolves structures that encode both organisms and the ecological roles they inhabit.

3. Supporting Evidence

3.1 Convergent Evolution
The repeated emergence of similar body plans and behaviors in unrelated lineages (e.g., saber-toothed predators, flight, bioluminescence) suggests a limited and predictable set of adaptive solutions — implying structured genetic potential.

3.2 Co-evolution and Ecological Encoding
Predator-prey arms races (e.g., bats and moths), parasitism (e.g., wasps laying eggs in hosts), and mimicry (e.g., anglerfish lures) reveal complex traits evolved not in isolation but as a response to the genetic and behavioral frameworks of other organisms.

3.3 Deep Homology and Genetic Toolkits
Highly conserved genetic modules (e.g., Hox genes) underlie diverse organisms and point to a shared, flexible developmental system capable of generating ecological complexity from common elements.

3.4 The Extended Phenotype and Niche Construction
Genes influence not only an organism’s body but its behavior and its modifications to the environment, which in turn affect evolutionary pressures — effectively coding for systemic ecological functions.

4. Implications

DNA as a Systemic Code: Life is not an additive process of isolated innovations, but a recursive, self-referencing system where DNA encodes relational forms.

Ecosystem Evolution: Evolution operates at a higher-order level, producing not just organisms but ecological systems through iterative feedback loops.

Synthetic and Artificial Life: Understanding DNA as an ecosystem-generative system may inform the design of artificial biospheres or synthetic ecologies.

5. Future Directions

Mapping the latent phenotypic and ecological potential in genomes.

Simulating artificial ecologies from minimal DNA-like code.

Developing metrics for evolutionary "network entanglement" between genomes.

6. Conclusion

The hypothesis reframes evolution as a system-level process, with DNA acting as a dynamic substrate capable of generating not just organisms, but whole ecosystems. Over time, evolution appears to uncover — rather than invent — complex biological functions already embedded in the generative structure of life’s code. DNA is thus not only a molecular archive but a potential-rich engine of systemic biological emergence.
